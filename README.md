I am creating an interactive flashcard application to learn the 500 essential B1 French words. This single-page application allows you to study words by category, flip the cards to view the translation, navigate through the deck, and shuffle the cards for a more effective learning experience.
## Levels:
### A1: https://pooriadf.github.io/learning_french/flashcards_A1
